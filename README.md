&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you still buying a DC brushless motor drive module for more than 10￥? Are you still worried about the high noise, low response speed and low life of brush motor? Let's take a look at this project, a FOC brushless motor control scheme that can be done for 20￥!  **miniFOC** has built-in torque closed-loop controller to provide you with a brushless motor controller that can be controlled through 3-wire serial port. The project is planned to complete the development of basic functions by the end of August 2021. The software and hardware design fully comply with the AGPL-3.0 License.
